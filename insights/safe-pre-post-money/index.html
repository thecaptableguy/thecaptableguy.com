                            Startup fundraising is filled with terms that sound similar but have real implications for
                            your cap table. One of the most commonly misunderstood distinctions is between pre-money
                            SAFEs and post-money SAFEs. Both are tools for raising capital without setting a valuation
                            today — but how they impact ownership and dilution is very different.

                        <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed">
                            A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) is a form of convertible security that allows
                            investors to invest in your company today, with the promise of receiving equity in the
                            future — usually when a priced round occurs. Created by Y Combinator in 2013, SAFEs are
                            simpler and faster than traditional convertible notes because they don't accrue interest or
                            have a maturity date.

                                        <strong>For founders:</strong> Pre-money SAFEs seem attractive upfront, but can
                                        lead to unpredictable and painful dilution.

                                        Because of this clarity, post-money SAFEs have become the new standard in most

                            The trend has been to move away from pre-money SAFEs and instead use post-money SAFEs. They
                            are both excellent structures when used properly.
                        </p>

                            If you're raising on SAFEs — especially multiple SAFEs over time — it's critical to
                            understand how they impact your ownership. Don't treat SAFEs as "not real equity." They are
                            equity, and when they convert, they can take a larger bite out of your cap table than
                            expected.

                            Always model the dilution, ideally using a cap table tool or working with an expert. Your
                            future self (and co-founders) will thank you.
