                            In early-stage investing, alignment is everything. Founders want capital to build, and
                            investors want to be compensated for the risks they're taking. That's the implicit promise
                            of a SAFE note: a simple agreement that defers valuation to the next priced round, while
                            giving early believers a better deal.
                        </p>

                            But not all SAFEs are created equalâ€”I think the best ones include both a valuation cap and a
                            discount.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            A valuation cap sets the maximum price at which a SAFE will convert into equity. If things
                            go wellâ€”if the startup raises at a high valuation, early investors still convert at a more
                            favorable price.
                        </p>

                                <p class="text-base-content/80">The cap aligns the investor with the founder on the
                                    upside. It rewards conviction when others weren't yet convinced.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Without a cap, a $250K SAFE investor might end up converting at the same valuation as a $10M
                            Series A investor, despite taking exponentially more risk. That's not alignmentâ€”it's a
                            penalty for being early.

                            If the company raises at a $10M valuation vs. a $100M valuation, without a cap, the investor
                            gets the same return regardless.

                            The discount gives investors equity at a percentage below the next round's priceâ€”20% is
                            pretty standard. It acts as a risk premium, compensating for early capital in scenarios
                            where the startup doesn't hockey-stick but makes enough meaningful progress to raise a
                            priced round.

                                    raise flat, or with only modest gains. In these middle-of-the-road outcomes, the
                                    discount is the only way early investors are compensated for their risk.</p>

                            Without a discount, an investor might fund a company at napkin stage and then still pay the
                            same price as a new investor who comes in much later investors. That's misaligned and
                            unjustified.

                            Including both a cap and a discount ensures the investor is protected on the downside,
