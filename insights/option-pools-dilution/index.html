                            When you're negotiating a funding round, one of the most important — and most misunderstood
                            — sources of founder dilution is the option pool. It's not always obvious, but how the
                            option pool is sized and when it's calculated can have a major impact on your cap table.

                                    An option pool is a portion of a company's shares reserved for future employees,
                                    advisors, and consultants. It ensures you have enough equity to attract top talent
                                    after the round.
                                </p>

                                    Typically, VCs want to see a 10–20% option pool post-financing, so new hires can be
                                    incentivized without further diluting investors.

                                    But here's the twist: where and when the option pool is created matters a lot.

                                <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    In most VC term sheets, investors will ask for the option pool to be included in the
                                    pre-money valuation.
                                </p>

                                    This means that the founders—not the investors—bear the dilution from the new option
                                    pool.
                                </p>

                                        <li>Pre-money valuation = $10M</li>
                                        <li>VC is investing $5M for 33.3% ownership (post-money)</li>

                                        In effect, the founders are giving up an extra 15% on top of the equity sold to
                                        the VC — even though those options haven't been granted yet. Your final cap
                                        table will mean the existing shareholders have been diluted by 48.3%.

                                    It's not malicious — it's just math. VCs want the company to have enough room to
                                    hire a team post-investment, without their equity being diluted. So they push that
                                    dilution onto the founders before they invest.
