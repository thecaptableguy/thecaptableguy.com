                                    50/50 — but didn't sign a vesting agreement.

                                    of the cap table left. Investors passed, and new hires didn't like the math.

                                    Many founders focus on how much money they're raising — not how much equity they're
                                    giving up.

                                    One startup raised a large Series A at a great valuation. But the founders were
                                    surprised to see their ownership drop from 60% to less than 35%, once the pre-money
                                    option pool expansion and convertible notes were factored in.

                                    They hadn't modeled it in advance. They thought the dilution would be ~20%, but it
                                    was nearly 40%.

                            Your cap table is one of the most valuable — and fragile — assets in your startup.

                            Most of these problems aren't caused by greed or incompetence. They happen because founders
                            are moving fast, and equity feels abstract — until it's very real.
                        </p>

                            Take it seriously. Clean it up early. Ask for help if you need it. The founders who
                            understand their cap tables usually raise faster, hire better, and win bigger.
