# Understanding Cap Tables: A Founder's Guide to Ownership


## Introduction
If you’re a founder, investor, or early employee at a startup, there’s one document you must understand deeply: the cap table.

Short for “capitalization table,” your cap table tells the story of who owns what — and how that might change as your company grows. It’s one of the most important (and misunderstood) tools in startup life.

Here’s an overview of what a cap table is, why it matters, and how to think about it at every stage of your company.


## What Is a Cap Table?

A cap table is a record of a company’s equity ownership. It typically includes:

Founders’ shares
Investor ownership from equity rounds or convertibles
Employee stock option pool (ESOP)
Outstanding SAFEs, notes, warrants, or other convertible securities
It shows who owns what — in both number of shares and percent of the company — and how that ownership will change after financing, hiring, or exits.


## Why Cap Tables Matter

Cap tables are about more than numbers. They reflect the distribution of power, control, and economics in your company.

They affect:

🧠 Decision-making: Voting rights and board control
💰 Fundraising: How much you give up in each round
🧲 Recruiting: What you can offer to future employees
🏁 Exits: Who gets what in an acquisition or IPO
If your cap table is unclear, messy, or misunderstood — it can blow up a deal or create founder friction down the road.


## Key Concepts to Know

1. Fully Diluted Shares

This is the total number of shares outstanding if all options, SAFEs, notes, and warrants convert. This is the denominator investors care about.

2. Ownership vs. Value

Owning 10% of a startup worth $5M isn’t the same as owning 10% of one worth $50M. The cap table tracks percentages, but value is always changing.

3. Pre-Money vs. Post-Money

Pre-money valuation is the company’s value before new investment.
Post-money = pre-money + new investment.
Important when modeling dilution and pricing new rounds.

4. Option Pool

Shares reserved for employees and advisors. Usually 10–20%, often added before a funding round — which dilutes founders more than investors.


## Cap Table Stages: How It Evolves

🟢 Early Stage (Friends & Founders)

Founders split shares — ideally with vesting
Option pool is created
Maybe a few friends/family or angel SAFEs
🔵 Seed Round

SAFEs/convertible notes start converting
Institutional investors come in
Option pool top-up often required
Cap table starts getting complex
🟣 Series A+

Priced rounds with negotiated ownership
Multiple share classes (common vs. preferred)
Protective provisions, board seats, liquidation preferences
Dilution begins to snowball
🟠 Later Stages

Multiple rounds, employee turnover, option refreshes
Secondary sales and liquidity events
Exit planning, waterfalls, and tax considerations


## Common Mistakes

❌ No founder vesting
❌ Giving away too much equity early
❌ Not modeling dilution before raising
❌ Verbal promises not reflected on the cap table
❌ Not understanding convertibles and SAFEs
A bad cap table can scare off investors, block fundraising, or create costly surprises in M&A.

## Final Thoughts: Own Your Cap Table

Your cap table is your scoreboard, your roadmap, and your control panel. Whether you’re a first-time founder or a seasoned operator, understanding it is essential.

Don’t outsource it blindly.   Work with a Cap Table expert who can help you fully understand it.

Review it regularly. Model scenarios. Ask questions. The earlier you take ownership of your cap table, the stronger position you'll be in for every future decision.
