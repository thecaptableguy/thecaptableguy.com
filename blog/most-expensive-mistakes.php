                                    One of the first startups I ever worked with had two co-founders who split equity
                                    50/50 — but didn't sign a vesting agreement.
                                </p>

                                    company, fully owned.
                                </p>

                                    Now the remaining founder was trying to raise money and hire a team — with only 50%
                                    of the cap table left. Investors passed, and new hires didn't like the math.

                                    option pool expansion and convertible notes were factored in.

                            Your cap table is one of the most valuable — and fragile — assets in your startup.

                            Most of these problems aren't caused by greed or incompetence. They happen because founders
                            are moving fast, and equity feels abstract — until it's very real.

                            Take it seriously. Clean it up early. Ask for help if you need it. The founders who
                            understand their cap tables usually raise faster, hire better, and win bigger.
