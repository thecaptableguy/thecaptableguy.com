# Why SAFE Notes Should Always Include Both a Cap and a Discount

## Introduction
In early-stage investing, alignment is everything. Founders want capital to build, and investors want to be compensated for the risks they’re taking. That’s the implicit promise of a SAFE note: a simple agreement that defers valuation to the next priced round, while giving early believers a better deal. But not all SAFEs are created equal—I think the best ones include both a valuation cap and a discount.

Let’s unpack why.

# The Cap: Aligning on the Upside

A valuation cap sets the maximum price at which a SAFE will convert into equity.  If things go well—if the startup raises at a high valuation, early investors still convert at a more favorable price.

Why it matters: The cap aligns the investor with the founder on the upside. It rewards conviction when others weren’t yet convinced.

Without a cap, a $250K SAFE investor might end up converting at the same valuation as a $10M Series A investor, despite taking exponentially more risk. That’s not alignment—it’s a penalty for being early.

If the company raises at a $10M valuation vs. a $100M valuation, without a cap, the investor gets the same return regardless.

# The Discount: Protecting the Downside

The discount gives investors equity at a percentage below the next round’s price—20% is pretty standard. It acts as a risk premium, compensating for early capital in scenarios where the startup doesn’t hockey-stick but makes enough meaningful progress to raise a priced round.

Why it matters: Not every startup raises at a $100M valuation. Many raise flat, or with only modest gains. In these middle-of-the-road outcomes, the discount is the only way early investors are compensated for their risk.

Without a discount, an investor might fund a company at napkin stage and then still pay the same price as a new investor who comes in much later investors. That’s misaligned and unjustified.

Both = Fairness Across the Spectrum

Including both a cap and a discount ensures the investor is protected on the downside, fairly rewarded in middling outcomes, and appropriately aligned on the upside.

It avoids two traps:

Cap-only SAFEs: Great if the company 10x’s in valuation, but offer no compensation if the next round is flat or slightly up.
Discount-only SAFEs: Fine for modest outcomes, but completely miss out on the upside if the startup takes off.
In short, a SAFE with both a cap and discount offers a complete picture of risk and reward.

# Founders: This Isn’t a Giveaway

Some founders worry that including both terms is giving away too much, but only one of the conversion terms will be used upon conversion, proving appropriate risk/reward profile for early investors.

A cap + discount SAFE isn’t overly generous. It’s a fair deal that reflects risk and aligns incentives—and aligned incentives build enduring partnerships.

# Conclusion: SAFE, Not Sorry

A SAFE note should be just that: safe for founders to raise and fair for investors to fund. The cap rewards belief in the upside. The discount protects the risk taken. Together, they create a structure that honors the journey, no matter where it leads.  Having a SAFE with both a cap and discount provides better alignment with your investors.
